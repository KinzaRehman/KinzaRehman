- 👋 Hi, I’m @KinzaRehman
- 👀 I am passionate about developing applications that use camera technology
to facilitate object recognition, enable measurements, and provide
translation capabilities along with user interaction. My focus is on creating 
innovative and user-friendly solutions that harness the power of visual data
to enhance user experiences and carry out tasks.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to monetize and import data from different sources.
- 💞️ I'm working towards getting my masters in computer engineering and data statistics.
